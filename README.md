Traffic management and enforcement of road safety regulations have become increasingly 
crucial in modern urban environments, as the number of vehicles on the roads continues to surge. With 
the rise in traffic violations, particularly signal disobedience, there is a pressing need for innovative 
solutions  that  can  efficiently  detect  and  penalize  offenders  while  reducing  the  burden  on  law 
enforcement personnel.
The E-Challan System harnesses the power of cutting-edge computer vision techniques, most 
notably Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), to accurately capture and decipher vehicle 
number plates in real- time. High-resolution cameras strategically positioned at traffic junctions and 
signal intersections actively monitor passing vehicles, automatically detecting those that violate traffic 
signals.
Upon successful identification of a signal violation, the E-Challan System promptly generates 
an electronic challan, or e-challan, containing detailed information about the violation, such as the 
date, time, and location of the incident. This comprehensive documentation serves as indisputable 
evidence of the offense and provides an essential legal foundation for imposing fines on violators. with 
an Auto Debit Fine mechanism.
